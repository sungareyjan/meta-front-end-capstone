# Little Lemon Booking Website Meta Front End Capstone


## Project Description:

This project emerged as the culmination of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, serving as a tangible representation of the acquired skills throughout the Front-End Development Track.

Focused on enhancing the user experience on the Little Lemon Website, the project centers around the implementation of a booking application. Leveraging React Components, the website demonstrates a proficient use of React for crafting dynamic and responsive interfaces. Furthermore, the integration of API calls underscores the project's commitment to real-world data interactions.

It's important to clarify that, at its current state, the website's primary functional feature is the "Reserve a Table" functionality. While the design elements showcase the aesthetic aspect, the project underscores a dedicated focus on the practical application of React and API utilization, offering a solid foundation for future feature expansion and refinement
